          "Valora" draws inspiration from the word valor, symbolizing courage,
          strength, and resilience. It embodies the spirit of empowerment and
          safety for women everywhere. Through Valora, we aim to ignite
          confidence and provide real-time support, ensuring that every woman
          feels protected and empowered to navigate the world without fear. More
          than just an app, Valora stands as a movement towards building a
          safer, stronger, and more united community for women.
